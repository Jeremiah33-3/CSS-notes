### Selectors
> A selector targets HTML to apply styles to content

A selector list, combining the selectors, separated by comma:
```css
h1, .special {
  color: blue;
}
```

Types of selectors:
- type selectors: target an HTML element such as <h1> `h1`, [universal selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors/Type_Class_and_ID_Selectors#type_selectors) *
- Class selectors target an element that has a specific value for its class attribute `.class_selector`
- ID selectors target an element that has a specific value for its id attribute `#unique`
- attribute selectors: this group of selectors gives you different ways to select elements based on the presence of a certain attribute on an element
- pseudo-classes  style certain states of an element `a:hover`
- pseudo-elements select a certain part of an element rather than the element itself: `p::first-line`
- combinators: combine other selectors in order to target elements within our documents: `article > p`

Class selectors hacks:
- target classes on particular elements:
```css
span.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
}

h1.highlight {
  background-color: pink;
}
```
- target elements with more than one classes applied:
```html
<div class="notebox">
    This is an informational note.
</div>

<div class="notebox warning">
    This note shows a warning.
</div>

<div class="notebox danger">
    This note shows danger!
</div>

<div class="danger">
    This won't get styled â€” it also needs to have the notebox class
</div>
```
```css
.notebox {
  border: 4px solid #666;
  padding: .5em;
}

.notebox.warning {
  border-color: orange;
  font-weight: bold;
}

.notebox.danger {
  border-color: red;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

ID selectors hacks:
- Using the same ID multiple times in a document may appear to work for styling purposes, but don't do this. It results in invalid code, and will cause strange behavior in many places. (an ID can be used only once per page, and elements can only have a single id value applied to them)

[Attribute selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors/Attribute_selectors) hacks:
- presence and value selectors:selection of an element based on the presence of an attribute alone (for example href), or on various different matches against the value of the attribute.
  - `a[title]`
  - equal: `a[href="https://example.com"]`
  - exactly or contains a value: `p[class~="special"]`
  - exactly value or begins with value immediately followed by a hyphen `div[lang|="zh"]`
- substring matching selectors:
  - Matches elements with an attribute, whose value begins with value. `li[class^="box-"]`
  - Matches elements with an attr attribute whose value ends with value. `li[class$="-box"]`
  - Matches elements with an attr attribute whose value contains value anywhere within the string. `li[class*="box"]`
- use flag i `li[class^="a" i]` to achieve case-insensitivity

Cascade Specificity - when two selectors select the same HTML element, CSS use rules to select the stronger selector
- cascade rule says that the later style will override previous ones
- between class and element, specificity says that class is more specific than element selector, so it override element selector's style

### Properties and values
> Properties: These are human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic features you want to modify. For example, font-size, width, background-color. Values: Each property is assigned a value. This value indicates how to style the property.

These are the basic CSS components. When a property is paired with a value, this pairing is called a CSS declaration. They are case-insensitive, and separated by a colon.

Some values can exist in the form of functions:
- calc(), [transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform) property's functions

### @rules
> CSS @rules (pronounced "at-rules") provide instruction for what CSS should perform or how it should behave. Some @rules are simple with just a keyword and a value. For example, @import imports a stylesheet into another CSS stylesheet.

For example:
- `@import` rule can import a stylesheet into another stylesheet
- `@media` create [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries), which uses conditional logic for applying CSS styling. E.g.
```css
body {
  background-color: pink;
}

@media (min-width: 30em) {
  body {
    background-color: blue;
  }
}
```

### Shorthands
> Some properties like font, background, padding, border, and margin are called shorthand properties. This is because shorthand properties set several values in a single line.

Sort of like a function accepting multiple arguments
E.g.
```css
/* In 4-value shorthands like padding and margin, the values are applied
   in the order top, right, bottom, left (clockwise from the top). There are also other
   shorthand types, for example 2-value shorthands, which set padding/margin
   for top/bottom, then left/right */
padding: 10px 15px 15px 5px;
```
which is equivalent to:
```css
padding-top: 10px;
padding-right: 15px;
padding-bottom: 15px;
padding-left: 5px;
```

### Comments
No comments, just `/* */`



## Miscellaneous 
To change default behaviour of elements: 
```css
li {
  list-style-type: none;
}
```

Styling things based on their location in a document;
- descendant combinator:
```css
li em {
  color: rebeccapurple; /* select only <em> element inside <li> tag */
}
```
- next-sibling combinator
```css
h1 + p {
  font-size: 200%; /* select <p> element next to the h1 element (same indentation) */
}
```

Styling things based on states:
- html elements might have different states (e.g. <a> (anchor) element. This has different states depending on whether it is unvisited, visited, being hovered over, focused via the keyboard, or in the process of being clicked (activated).)
```css
a:link {
  color: pink;
}

a:visited {
  color: green;
}

a:hover {
  text-decoration: none;
}
```

You can also combine combinators and selectors together:
```css
/* selects any <span> that is inside a <p>, which is inside an <article>  */
article p span {
}

/* selects any <p> that comes directly after a <ul>, which comes directly after an <h1>  */
h1 + ul + p {
}

/* multiple types */
body h1 + p .special {
  color: yellow;
  background-color: black;
  padding: 5px;
}
```
